    "abstract": "Libraries incessantly undergo change determined by evolving user needs. These are often induced by the emergence of previously unavailable tools. Web 2.0 represents an example of such a need-shifting technology, which has led to an embrace of new user interactivity services for many library websites, thus coined Library 2.0. This paradigm shift calls for new evaluation models to include the implementation of Web 2.0 technologies. The aim of this paper is to present such a model, and to evaluate the quality of Library 2.0 functionalities, measuring the quality of the 2.0 services offered through the websites based on user perception. We adopt fuzzy linguistic modeling to represent user perception, and apply aggregation operations to linguistic labels in order to evaluate the quality of the new services. Furthermore, our model subsumes the LibQUAL+methodology, allowing for the identification of specific 2.0 functionalities in need of improvement and of those outstandingly satisfied by the system.

    "abstract": "Future broadband networks will provide end-to-end connections which span multiple networks, operators, domains and technologies. The abil- ity to supply end-to-end connections depends on the ability to satisfy (in near real-time) end-user topology, schedule (availability of resources in the present or future), quality of service and cost constraints. This paper examines the problems imposed by schedule constraints, as they allow operators and service providers the ability to differentiate their offerings above the traditional con- nectivity, QoS, and cost basis. Such constraints are strongly linked to QoS is- sues, and also to maximizing the use of shared network resources and are there- fore quite important for management of future broadband networks. In order to satisfy temporal constraints imposed by scheduled connections, both the man- agement systems and managed resources involved must provide appropriate support. This paper presents an overview of several important management is- sues that are involved in the support of scheduled connections.",

    "abstract": "Response latencies were recorded during a continuous performance task using four standard microcomputer response media: the standard QWERTY keyboard, a numeric keypad, a light-pen and a touch-screen. There were significant differences among these media, the fastest responses being made with the touch-screen, and the slowest with the light-pen. The keypad was superior to the full keyboard. Within devices, the physical layout of the key-based devices accounted for the differences among responses with specific keys. A common pattern of response using the touch-screen and light-pen was found, with a constant offset of 309 ms for the light-pen. A tentative model of response execution with these screen-based devices is presented, with implications for the nature of response parameters in unconstrained response environments, and for the design of human-computer interfaces.",

Capacitive microsensors are ubiquitously employed in many applications pertaining to all aspects of modern life. The proposed circuit requires a small chip area and offers a good signal-to-noise ratio as well as adjustable sensitivity and dynamic range. Reference signals are produced on chip and used for the synchronous demodulation of current signals through a differential capacitive sensor. In addition to the normal open-loop operation mode of the circuit, it can be operated within a novel closed-loop configuration in order to extend its dynamic range. The circuit was designed and fabricated in a standard 0.35-μm CMOS technology from Austriamicrosystems. Experimental and simulation results are presented and discussed. The circuit is capable of resolving 0.4 fF of variation in capacitance with a 50-kHz measurement bandwidth. Reducing the bandwidth to 1 kHz for signal frequencies around 10 kHz increases the dynamic range of the closed-loop circuit to 99 and 110 dB for open-loop and closed-loop circuits, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of brain atrophy are often considered to be a marker of axonal loss in multiple sclerosis (MS) but evidence is limited. Optic neuritis is a common manifestation of MS and results in optic nerve atrophy. Retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) imaging is a non-invasive way of detecting axonal loss following optic neuritis. We hypothesise that if the optic nerve atrophy that develops following optic neuritis is contributed to by axonal loss, it will correlate with thinning of the RNFL. Twenty-five patients were studied at least 1 year after a single unilateral attack of optic neuritis without recurrence, with a selection bias towards incomplete recovery. They had MR quantification of optic nerve cross-sectional area and optic nerve lesion length, as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement of mean RNFL thickness and macular volume, quantitative visual testing, and visual evoked potentials (VEPs). Fifteen controls were also studied. Significant optic nerve atrophy (mean decrease 30% versus controls), RNFL thinning (mean decrease 33% versus controls), and macular volume loss occurred in patients' affected eyes when compared with patients' unaffected eyes and healthy controls. The optic nerve atrophy was correlated with the RNFL thinning, macular volume loss, visual acuity, visual field mean deviation, and whole field VEP amplitude but not latency.",

We consider a special case of the general n-channel symmetric multiple-description problem where only a single parameter controls the redundancy tradeoffs between the central and the side distortions. Previous work on two-channel MD-LVQ showed that the distortions of the side quantizers can be expressed through the normalized second moment of a sphere. We show here that this is also the case for three-channel MD-LVQ. Furthermore, we conjecture that this is true for the general n-channel MD-LVQ. For given source, target rate, and packet-loss probabilities we find the optimal number of descriptions and construct the MD-LVQ system that minimizes the expected distortion. We verify theoretical expressions by numerical simulations and show in a practical setup that significant performance improvements can be achieved over state-of-the-art two-channel MD-LVQ by using three-channel MD-LVQ.",

This paper presents two versions of a steepest descent gradient algorithm that prewhiten the signal received by an arbitrarily oriented volumetric sensor array, minimizing these undesirable effects. The algorithms optimize a whiteness functional over a surface with desirable properties including low dimensionality, unimodality, and concavity. Two ambient noise models facilitate algorithm development through succinct parameterization. The first, which is a novel linear matricial ambient noise model based on a spherical harmonic expansion, places no constraints on array geometry. The second model requires a spatially uniformly sampled sensor array and reduces problem dimensionality associated with exact multidimensional autoregressive modeling. The algorithms estimate a stacked vector arrangement of the model parameters. Application with MUSIC demonstrates enhanced performance in terms of angular resolution and detection of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) sources",

The deployment of five stations into the rugged crater of Mount St. Helens only took one hour with a helicopter. The stations communicate with each other through an amplified 802.15.4 radio and establish a self-forming and self-healing multi-hop wireless network. The distance between stations is up to 2 km. Each sensor station collects and delivers real-time continuous seismic, infrasonic, lightning, GPS raw data to a gateway. The main contribution of this paper is the design and evaluation of a robust sensor network to replace data loggers and provide real-time long-term volcano monitoring. The system supports UTC-time synchronized data acquisition with 1ms accuracy, and is online configurable. It has been tested in the lab environment, the outdoor campus and the volcano crater. Despite the heavy rain, snow, and ice as well as gusts exceeding 120 miles per hour, the sensor network has achieved a remarkable packet delivery ratio above 99% with an overall system uptime of about 93.8% over the 1.5 months evaluation period after deployment.

This paper introduces an Adversarial Occlusion-aware Face Detector (AOFD) by simultaneously detecting occluded faces and segmenting occluded areas. Specifically, we employ an adversarial training strategy to generate occlusion-like face features that are difficult for a face detector to recognize. Occlusion mask is predicted simultaneously while detecting occluded faces and the occluded area is utilized as an auxiliary instead of being regarded as a hindrance. Moreover, the supervisory signals from the segmentation branch will reversely affect the features, aiding in detecting heavily-occluded faces accordingly. Consequently, AOFD is able to find the faces with few exposed facial landmarks with very high confidences and keeps high detection accuracy even for masked faces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AOFD not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MAFA occluded face detection dataset, but also achieves competitive detection accuracy on benchmark dataset for general face detection such as FDDB.",

The proposed system uses a rule-based approach to extract the entities from text and image captions. The entities extracted from text data are correlated using contextual as-well-as semantic similarity measures and image entities are correlated using low-level and high-level image features.

While GPU can remain idle during I/O and memory copy, prior work has shown that overlapping data movement (I/O and memory copies) with kernel execution can improve performance. However, when there are multiple dependent kernels, the execution of the kernels is serialized and the benefit of overlapping data movement can be limited. In order to improve the performance of workloads that have multiple dependent kernels, we propose to automatically overlap the execution of kernels by exploiting implicit pipeline parallelism. We first propose Coarse-grained Reference Counting-based Scoreboarding (CRCS) to guarantee correctness during overlapped execution of multiple kernels. However, CRCS alone does not necessarily improve overall performance if the thread blocks (or CTAs) are scheduled sequentially. Thus, we propose an alternative CTA scheduler -- Pipeline Parallelism-aware CTA Scheduler (PPCS) that takes available pipeline parallelism into account in CTA scheduling to maximize pipeline parallelism and improve overall performance. Our evaluation results show that the proposed mechanisms can improve performance by up to 67% (33% on average).

The acoustic reverberation depends on the shape and the composition of the room, and it causes temporal and spectral smearing of the recorded sound. The background noise, on the other hand, depends on the secondary audio source activities present in the evidentiary recording. Extraction of acoustic cues from an audio recording is an important but challenging task. Temporal changes in the estimated reverberation and background noise can be used for dynamic acoustic environment identification (AEI), audio forensics, and ballistic settings. We describe a statistical technique based on spectral subtraction to estimate the amount of reverberation and nonlinear filtering based on particle filtering to estimate the background noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested using a data set consisting of speech recordings of two human speakers (one male and one female) made in eight acoustic environments using four commercial grade microphones. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated for various experimental settings such as microphone independent, semi- and full-blind AEI, and robustness to MP3 compression.

For fine-grained all-optical switching ability and high bandwidth connection, optical burst switching (OBS) ring is deployed inside the micro-DCs (mDC) and OBS over wavelength switched optical network paradigm is used for inter-mDC communication. Meanwhile, hierarchical SDN control is employed to virtualize and holistically coordinate the distributed mDCs and the metro network slices into reconfigurable virtual DC (VDC). Optimal VDC provisioning based on an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation is also developed in the SDN control plane to provide services with minimum latency and traffic load. A dynamic VDC provisioning algorithm based on partial ILP is further proposed to reconfigure the VDC with reduced complexity considering the user and resource dynamics. Experimental demonstrations conducted on the implemented metro-embedded DC prototype testbed show that optimal and fast VDC provisioning is realized based on the proposed ILP, while dynamic VDC reconfiguration makes sure that VDC is adjusted accordingly with the change of user location and resource requirement.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) on General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) is now becoming one of the most significant techniques to balance computational performance and energy consumption. However, there are still few fast and accurate models for predicting GPU kernel execution time under different core and memory frequency settings, which is important to determine the best frequency configuration for energy saving. Accordingly, a novel GPGPU performance estimation model with both core and memory frequency scaling is herein proposed. We design a cross-benchmarking suite, which simulates kernels with a wide range of instruction distributions. The synthetic kernels generated by this suite can be used for model pre-training or as supplementary training samples. Then we apply two different machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), to study the correlation between kernel performance counters and kernel performance. The models trained only with our cross-benchmarking suite achieve satisfying accuracy (16%similar to 22% mean absolute error) on 24 unseen real application kernels. Validated on three modern GPUs with a wide frequency scaling range, by using a collection of 24 real application kernels, the proposed model is able to achieve accurate results (5.1%, 2.8%, 6.5% mean absolute error) for the target GPUs (GTX 980, Titan X Pascal and Tesla P100).",

    "abstract": "We consider large scale Publish/Subscribe systems deployed across multiple organizations. However, such cross organizational deployment is often hindered by firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs). Several workarounds have been proposed to allow firewall and NAT traversal, e.g. VPN, connection reversal, relay routers. However, each traversal mechanism in turn leads to trade-offs with respect to implementation complexity, infrastructure overhead, latency, etc. We focus on the latency aspect in this work. We propose a cost-performance model that allows quantitative evaluation of the performance latency induced by the different firewall traversal mechanisms. The utility of the model is that for a given network configuration, it is able to provide a (close) approximation of the performance latencies based on simulation results, without actually having to deploy them in practice. This also allows selecting the best traversal mechanism for a given configuration. Finally, experimental results are given to show the validity of the proposed model.",

    "abstract": "Wireless localization technology has become an important part of pervasive computing applications. This paper presents DE2, a wireless localization approach that is responsive to single beacon conditions. Unlike previous work that needs a priori knowledge of the scenario during the pre-deployment phase with significant human effort, or uses a certain number of beacons during the localization phase with high energy consumption, to accomplish localization, DE2 leverages a single beacon without much prior human effort to locate multiple targets. The key challenge is how to utilize the limited information caught by a single beacon and little human effort to obtain the positions of multiple unknowns. The intuition underlying DE2 is that, direction and distance constraints between an unknown position and the single beacon are adequate to determine the unknown position. When a user rotates around an RF receiver (the single beacon), the human body acts as a signal-blocking obstacle. It causes the signal from a transmitter (position-unknown) to the single receiver to attenuate in a certain scope. The blocking effect caused by a human body can be utilized to obtain the direction constraint between the unknown position and the single beacon. Moreover, a corresponding distance constraint is also concluded in the rotating RSS according to the RF propagation model. DE2 pushes the limit of minimum beacons needed for localization without much pre-configuration effort. To demonstrate the utility of DE2, we implement DE2 in realworld single beacon wireless networks. The results show that these applications can significantly benefit from DE2.",

We first define the robustness for the lane-reservation problem and formulate a biobjective mixed-integer linear program.

Computational results for an instance based on a real network topology and 220 randomly generated instances with up to 150 nodes, 600 arcs, and 50 tasks demonstrate that the proposed method is able to find the Pareto front and that the proposed cut-and-solve method is more efficient than the direct use of optimization software CPLEX.",

S-deduction consists of three rules which rely on a very simple form of unification that manipulates only variables and flat terms. These rules preserve flatness. We present a method for converting arbitrary sets of Horn clauses S into a flat form S′ in such a way that S-deduction is sound and complete with respect to unsatisfiability. It is also shown that S together with the usual axioms for equality is unsatisfiable if there is an S-refutation from S′. In the case when an S-deduction terminates with a clause consisting of equalities (a residuum), an appropriate interpretation for the nonunifiability is provided.

Currently, the honey bee populations are decreasing due to colony collapse disorder (CCD). The reasons for CCD are not fully known, and as a result, it is essential to obtain all possible information on the environmental conditions surrounding the beehives. On the other hand, it is important to carry out such information gathering as non-intrusively as possible to avoid modifying the bees' work conditions and to obtain more reliable data. We designed a wireless-sensor networks meet these requirements. We designed a remote monitoring system (called WBee) based on a hierarchical three-level model formed by the wireless node, a local data server, and a cloud data server. WBee is a low-cost, fully scalable, easily deployable system with regard to the number and types of sensors and the number of hives and their geographical distribution. WBee saves the data in each of the levels if there are failures in communication. In addition, the nodes include a backup battery, which allows for further data acquisition and storage in the event of a power outage. Unlike other systems that monitor a single point of a hive, the system we present monitors and stores the temperature and relative humidity of the beehive in three different spots. Additionally, the hive is continuously weighed on a weighing scale. Real-time weight measurement is an innovation in wireless beehive-monitoring systems. We designed an adaptation board to facilitate the connection of the sensors to the node.

We extend previous theoretical results on reweighted belief propagation to account for possible ties in the beliefs and using these results we obtain easily checkable conditions that guarantee that the BP disparities are the global optima.

In CGRAs, the on-chip memory hierarchy, which contains the context memory and the data memory organizations, should be well considered to achieve appropriate tradeoffs among three aspects: 1) performance; 2) area; and 3) power. In this paper, two techniques called the hierarchical configuration context (HCC) and the lifetime-based data-memory organization (LDO) focusing on the context memory and the data memory organizations are proposed to compress the on-chip memory space and to reduce the reconfiguration time and the data-reference time. In the HCC, the contexts are constructed in a hierarchical fashion to completely eliminate the repetitive portions of the contexts, not only reducing the overall context storage, but also alleviating the context transportation overhead. A fast context-indexing mechanism in the HCC is proposed to achieve fast reconfiguration, as the hierarchically organized contexts can be located and accessed conveniently. In the LDO, the on-chip data are classified into two types, based on the lifetime of data. The short-lifetime data are stored in the first in first out to increase the reuse ratio of memory space automatically, whereas the long-lifetime data are stored in the radom access memory for several time references. The HCC and the LDO are used in a CGRA core called as reconfigurable processing unit (RPU). Two RPUs are integrated in a reconfigurable computing processor (RCP) called as REconfigurable MUlti-media System, High-Performance Processor (REMUS_HPP). Because of the HCC, compared with a traditional nonhierarchical system, the total context storage required in H.264 decoding is reduced by 77%. Because of the LDO, the normalized on-chip data memory size at same performance level in the REMUS_HPP is only 23.8% and 14.8% of those in XPP-III (a high-performance RCP) and ADRES (a low-power RCP).

    "abstract": "Along with recent experiments in the design of communication or computer tools for supporting various kinds of group working, the development ofcollaborative drawing systems has emerged as a notable research area within the field of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work. This paper reports a survey of the experiments in collaborative drawing support tools with an objective of reviewing how the issues of supportingcollaborative design have been addressed by the research prototypes. The survey is presented in three parts: (1) findings from the observations of group interaction in drawing and design activities, (2) a framework for classifying the design issues experimented with by prototypes developers, and (3) a categorisation of the current prototype systems by interrelating the patterns of group use observed with the system features classified. The survey indicates that there are currently at least three different strategies of developing collaborative drawing support tools, which reflect the existence of diversified understanding and technological responses to what and how human collaboration in design may be supported.",

    "abstract": "Metering of the energy supplied to consumers is an important component of operations for utility providers. Several schemes have been employed for this purpose, including traditional postpaid and prepaid metering, and more advanced smart metering technology. Analysis of the data generated by these meters has the potential to provide insights into consumer characteristics and power consumption patterns, including consumer segmentation and anomaly detection. We describe the different types of power purchase and consumption data, as well as the analytics algorithms that can be applied to them. Most applications developed for energy meter data require high resolution information of the type provided by smart meters, thus leaving aggregate prepaid or postpaid meter schemes at a disadvantage. In this paper, we present analytics-based methodologies to upgrade aggregate prepaid and postpaid meter data resolution, which will allow smart meter analytics to be applied without expensive infrastructure upgrades.",

    "abstract": "In recent years we have seen numerous proof-of-concept attacks on implantable medical devices such as pacemakers. Attackers aim to breach the strict operational constraints that these devices operate within, with the end-goal of compromising patient safety and health. Most efforts to prevent these kinds of attacks are informal, and focus on application- and system-level security --- for instance, using encrypted communications and digital certificates for program verification. However, these approaches will struggle to prevent all classes of attacks. Runtime verification has been proposed as a formal methodology for monitoring the status of implantable medical devices. Here, if an attack is detected a warning is generated. This leaves open the risk that the attack can succeed before intervention can occur. In this paper, we propose a runtime-enforcement based approach for ensuring patient security. Custom hardware is constructed for individual patients to ensure a safe minimum quality of service at all times. To ensure correctness we formally verify the hardware using a model-checker. We present our approach through a pacemaker case study and demonstrate that it incurs minimal overhead in terms of execution time and power consumption.",

Typically, this error is characterized by the lack of interdependence among certain subgroups of the parameters to be estimated, which leads to minimization problems possessing a sparse structure. Taking advantage of this sparseness during minimization is known to achieve enormous computational savings. Nevertheless, since the underlying sparsity pattern is problem-dependent, its exploitation for a particular estimation problem requires non-trivial implementation effort, which often discourages its pursuance in practice. Based on recent developments in sparse linear solvers, this paper provides an overview of sparseLM, a generalpurpose software package for sparse non-linear least squares that can exhibit arbitrary sparseness and presents results from its application to important sparse estimation problems in geometric vision.",

In this paper, it is shown that the perceptual quality performance of SLS at intermediate rates can be further improved by incorporating psychoacoustic model into the bit-plane coding process.

As such there is an increasing need for fast and reliable online travel time prediction models. In an operational context, also adaptivity of such models is a crucial property. This paper describes a method to calibrate (train) a data driven travel time prediction model (a so-called state-space neural network - SSNN) in an incremental fashion. Since travel times are available only for realized trips, travel time prediction is not a one-step prediction task, and thus online incremental learning methods such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) can not be applied directly. We propose a delayed EKF method which can be applied online. By constraining the model parameters within particular bounds, an automatic regularization scheme is incorporated, which guarantees a smooth mapping",

Optimal scheduling of hydrogeneration, in coordination with other energy sources, is a stochastic problem of practical significance to PG&E. SOCRATES is a system for the optimal scheduling of PG&E's various energy sources over a one- to two-year horizon. This paper concentrates on the component of SOCRATES that schedules hydro. The core is a stochastic optimization model, solved using Benders decomposition. Additional components are streamflow forecasting models and a database containing hydrological information.

It represents an alternative to the well-known correlation beamforming paradigm. The chirp beamformer uses a chirp pulse as a symbol waveform. In comparison with a correlation beamformer, the chirp beamformer requires considerably lower timing resolution in cases where the IR-UWB symbol consists of a relatively long single uninterrupted waveform, as in the mandatory modes of two of the IEEE 802.15 IR-UWB standards, namely IEEE 802.15.4a-2007 and IEEE 802.15.6-2012. Furthermore, the bandwidth of the signal that the chirp beamformer generates in the baseband is considerably lower than in the case of the correlation beamformer. Hence, in the case of digital baseband signal generation, the chirp beamformer requires a considerably lower sampling rate than the correlation beamformer. A method for shaping the beam pattern of the chirp beamformer is also described. All concepts introduced are illustrated by numerical examples.",

The article also introduces a generalization of the ordinary binomial tree and presents a representation of caches in this class using the Generalized Binomial Tree (gbt). The tree representation permits efficient search and update of the caches. Theoretically, the new algorithm, GBF_LS, based on the gbt structure, always takes fewer comparisons than the two earlier algorithms for the same class of caches: all-associativity and generalized forest simulation. Experimentally, the new algorithm shows performance gains in the range of 1.2 to 3.8 over the earlier algorithms on address traces of the SPEC benchmarks. A related algorithm for simulating multiple alternative direct-mapped caches with fixed cache size, but varying line size, is also presented.",

We show that this naturally leads to decomposing a queueing network into a set of Markov processes that jointly approximate the dynamics of the model and from which passage times are easily computed. Approximation accuracy of BE depends on the specific Bayesian network used to decompose the joint probability density. Hence, we propose a selection algorithm based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence to search for the Bayesian network that provides the most accurate results. Random models and case studies of increasing complexity show the significant accuracy gain of distribution estimates returned by BE compared to Markov and Chebyshev inequalities that are frequently used for percentile estimation in queueing networks.",

We thus attempt to integrate prosodic information into RNNLMs for improving speech recognition performance based on rescoring strategy. Firstly, three word-level prosodic features are extracted from speech and then passed to RNNLMs separately. Therefore RNNLMs predict the next word based on prosodic features and word history. Experiments conducted on LibriSpeech Corpus show that the word error rate decreases from 8.07% to 7.96%.

These results are corroborated with tests at limit, obtaining the same result. Consequently, each failure can be linked to overcurrent (latch-up) or overtemperature (secondary breakdown) events, which makes possible to distinguish between problems coming from driving strategies or thermal issues (uneven temperature distribution inside the module or packaging wear-out).",

This claim has remained controversial and much debated.

The validity of the analytically obtained bit-error rates (BERs) over binary symmetric channels (BSCs) for each of the decoding iterations is verified by the system simulation. It is then shown that the application of these coding schemes in the optical BPPM-CDMA communication system, which can be modeled as a BSC, significantly improves the system performance. Particularly, for a certain BER (less than 10-7) and bandwidth, the coded systems not only permit a higher number (more than twice) of active users, compared with the uncoded systems, but also can operate at higher channel bit rate (up to four times) with more than 10% energy saving. Furthermore, by increasing the number of code dimensions, less power (less than 40%) is required to achieve the desired performance",

In particular, Java has helped in handling the heterogeneity of such environments. However, there is a lot of ground to cover regarding facilities to easily and elegantly parallelizing applications. One path to this end seems to be the synthesis of semi-automatic parallelism and Parallelism as a Concern (PaaC). The former allows users to be mostly unaware of parallel exploitation problems and at the same time manually optimize parallelized applications whenever necessary, while the latter allows applications to be separated from parallel-related code. In this paper, we present EasyFJP, an approach that implicitly exploits parallelism in Java applications based on the concept of fork-join synchronization pattern, a simple but effective abstraction for creating and coordinating parallel tasks. In addition, EasyFJP lets users to explicitly optimize applications through policies, or user-provided rules to dynamically regulate task granularity. Finally, EasyFJP relies on PaaC by means of source code generation techniques to wire applications and parallel-specific code together.

We set up a generic framework for training a network to perform navigation tasks based on imitation learning. It can be applied to both aerial and land vehicles. As a proof of concept we apply it to a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in a simulated environment, learning to cross a room containing a number of obstacles. So far only feedforward neural networks (FNNs) have been used to train UAV control. To cope with more complex tasks, we propose the use of recurrent neural networks (RNN) instead and successfully train an LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) network for controlling UAVs. Vision based control is a sequential prediction problem, known for its highly correlated input data. The correlation makes training a network hard, especially an RNN. To overcome this issue, we investigate an alternative sampling method during training, namely window-wise truncated backpropagation through time (WW-TBPTT).

The method proposed in this article uses a pattern similar to that of a chess board, which is found automatically in each image, when no information regarding the number of rows or columns is supplied to aid its detection. This is carried out by means of a combined analysis of two Hough transforms, image corners and invariant properties of the perspective transformation. Comparative analysis with more commonly used algorithms demonstrate the viability of the algorithm proposed, as a valuable tool for camera calibration.",

Not using neither obtaining personal local information but only average ones, our method fully complies with privacy and confidentiality. Our findings show that large cities display the behaviour of highly fragmented trust networks where individuals face possible phenomena of alienation. Smaller cities and villages instead behave like fully connected social systems with a rich tie structure, where isolation is rare or completely absent.

The scale of deployment of edge servers coupled with the rising costs of their administration demand that such caching middleware be adaptive and self-managing. To achieve this, a cache must be dynamically populated and pruned based on the application query stream and access pattern. In this paper, we describe such a cache which maintains a large number of materialized views of previous query results. Cached \"views\" share physical storage to avoid redundancy, and are usually added and evicted dynamically to adapt to the current workload and to available resources. These two properties of large scale (large number of cached views) and overlapping storage introduce several challenges to query matching and storage management which are not addressed by traditional approaches. In this paper, we describe an edge data cache architecture with a flexible query matching algorithm and a novel storage management policy which work well in such an environment. We perform an evaluation of a prototype of such an architecture using the TPC-W benchmark and find that it reduces query response times by up to 75%, while reducing network and server load.",

ELF allows one to visualize lone pair or nonbonding electrons, and in these cases the pi --> pi* or n --> pi excitation processes involved lead to an effective 90 degrees rotation of the electronic structure about one heavy atom center and consequent distortion towards pyramidal symmetry about both heavy atom centers. The heavy atom bond lengths change very little in those cases where effectively two-center three-electron bonds can be formed (HNNH, HNO, and O-2) while a significant lengthening occurs in those cases where hydrogen atoms prevent such interactions (H2CCH2, HNCH2, and H2CO).

The present work verifies the conjecture for LHOM(H) (and, indeed, for the wider class of conservative CSPs with binary constraints), and by so doing sharpens the aforementioned dichotomy.

Such sensors provide fully registered high resolution spatial and spectral images that are invaluable in discriminating between man-made objects and natural clutter backgrounds. The price paid for this high resolution data is extremely large data sets, several hundred of Mbytes for a single scene, that make storage and transmission difficult, thus requiring fast onboard processing techniques to reduce the data being transmitted. Attempts to apply traditional maximum likelihood detection techniques for in-flight processing of these massive amounts of hyperspectral data suffer from two limitations: first, they neglect the spatial correlation of the clutter by treating it as spatially white noise; second, their computational cost renders them prohibitive without significant data reduction like by grouping the spectral bands into clusters, with a consequent loss of spectral resolution. This paper presents a maximum likelihood detector that successfully confronts both problems: rather than ignoring the spatial and spectral correlations, our detector exploits them to its advantage; and it is computationally expedient, its complexity increasing only linearly with the number of spectral bands available. Our approach is based on a Gauss-Markov random field (GMRF) modeling of the clutter, which has the advantage of providing a direct parameterization of the inverse of the clutter covariance, the quantity of interest in the test statistic. We discuss in detail two alternative GMRF detectors: one based on a binary hypothesis approach, and the other on a “single” hypothesis formulation. We analyze extensively with real hyperspectral imagery data (HYDICE and SEBASS) the performance of the detectors, comparing them to a benchmark detector, the RX-algorithm. Our results show that the GMRF “single” hypothesis detector outperforms significantly in computational cost the RX-algorithm, while delivering noticeable detection performance improvement",

It is shown that an appropriate selection of the values of the parameter results in a number of new multiplication-free transforms having a good compromise between the computational complexity and performance. Applying the proposed transform to image compression, we show that it outperforms the existing transforms having complexities similar to that of the proposed one.",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing has become a powerful tool to derive biophysical properties of plants. One of the most popular methods for extracting vegetation information from remote sensing data is through vegetation indices. Models to predict soil erosion like the \"Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation\" (RUSLE) can use vegetation indices as input to measure the effects of soil cover. Several studies correlate vegetation indices with RUSLE's cover factor to get a linear mapping that describes a broad area. The results are considered as incomplete because most indices only detect healthy vegetation. The aim of this study is to devise a genetic programming approach to synthetically create vegetation indices that detect healthy, dry, and dead vegetation. In this work, the problem is posed as a search problem where the objective is to find the best indices that maximize the correlation of field data with Landsat5-TM imagery. Thus, the algorithm builds new indices by iteratively recombining primitive-operators until the best indices are found. This article outlines a GP methodology that was able to design new vegetation indices that are better correlated than traditional man-made indices. Experimental results demonstrate through a real world example using a survey at \"Todos Santos\" Watershed, that it is viable to design novel indices that achieve a much better performance than common indices such as NDVI, EVI, and SAVI.",

CloudBurst is a new parallel read-mapping algorithm optimized for mapping next-generation sequence data to the human genome and other reference genomes, for use in a variety of biological analyses including SNP discovery, genotyping and personal genomics. It is modeled after the short read-mapping program RMAP, and reports either all alignments or the unambiguous best alignment for each read with any number of mismatches or differences. This level of sensitivity could be prohibitively time consuming, but CloudBurst uses the open-source Hadoop implementation of MapReduce to parallelize execution using multiple compute nodes. Results: CloudBurst's running time scales linearly with the number of reads mapped, and with near linear speedup as the number of processors increases. In a 24-processor core configuration, CloudBurst is up to 30 times faster than RMAP executing on a single core, while computing an identical set of alignments. Using a larger remote compute cloud with 96 cores, CloudBurst improved performance by > 100-fold, reducing the running time from hours to mere minutes for typical jobs involving mapping of millions of short reads to the human genome.",

The axial flux machine is an interesting solution, where the motor is directly coupled or inside the driven wheel. In this paper, axial flux induction and synchronous machines as wheel motor application are presented, and some considerations for each motor type are drawn by the authors. The structure with two rotors seems to be a very promising solution for both induction and synchronous machines. The twin rotor structures allow saving of the motor active material: stator winding copper or stator core iron. Thus the machines can have higher power density and efficiency in comparison with two individual motors. In addition, for the induction case, the two rotors can rotate at different speeds, and thus the motor can act as a mechanical differential, even if supplied by a single invertor. The axial flux PM motor with two rotors is very compact and can be integrated inside the wheel.

Annotation sources include the GO association database (which contains data for over 200000 species), the Entrez gene2go table, and various manufacturers' array annotation files. This enables the creation of gene sets from the most up-to-date annotation data available. Additional features include the ability to restrict by evidence code, to remap gene descriptors, to filter by set size and to speed up repeat queries by caching the GO term hierarchy. Synonymous GO terms are remapped to the version preferred by the GO ontology supplied. The tool can be used in standalone form, or via a web interface. Prebuilt gene set collections constructed from the September 2013 GO release are also available for common species including human. In contrast human GO based sets available from the Broad Institute itself date from 2008.GO2MSIG enables the bioinformatician and non-bioinformatician alike to generate gene sets required for GSEA analysis for almost any organism for which GO term association data exists. The output gene sets may be used directly within GSEA and do not require knowledge of programming languages such as Perl, R or Python. The output sets can also be used with other analysis software such as ErmineJ that accept gene sets in the same format.

Le problème est de réaliser cette migration tout en gardant la qualité de l'existant rompu aux difficultés rencontrées. Ceci suppose une ré-ingénierie de ces applications. Dans certains cas, des solutions provisoires et non satisfaisantes ont été apportées sous forme de coopération externe. Celle-ci consiste par des moyens humains, logiciels et matériels, à mettre en relation certaines entités produisant de l'information à celles qui l'utilisent. Cette coopération externe présente divers inconvénients : souvent lente, peu efficace, peu souple, elle demande des moyens parfois disproportionnés en rapport aux gains obtenus. En automatisant la coopération nous pensons pouvoir éliminer l'ensemble des problèmes énumérés ci-dessus tout en améliorant tant du point de vue qualitatif que quantitatif la part prise par la coopération. Nous allons pour cela proposer une méthode basée sur une organisation des modules opératoires constituant l'application en groupes de travail dynamiques. Cette méthode permettra également de mettre en évidence les informations, de les mettre en relation et de les composer éventuellement afin d'en créer de nouvelles plus riches sémantiquement et donc plus à même d'être utilisées dans un environnement coopératif.

There an increasing demand from firms to evolve their applications to be more co-operative. The problem is to realise this migration and to maintain the quality of existing applications which are reliable due to previously encountered difficulties. This assumes the re-engineering of these applications. In some cases, temporary and non-satisfying applications have been added as external cooperation. It consists of human, software, hardware to link with some entities producing information for those who need it. This external cooperation presents several inconveniences : often slow, not very efficient and flexible. It also needs a lot of work, often disproportionate regarding to the gain. Automating cooperation, we hope to eliminate problems enumerated above, and we think that we can improve qualitatively and quantitatively the amount of co-operation. We will propose a method based on an organisation of dynamic workgroups composed of operative modules. This method will also allow to bring to the fore co-operative elements, and to link them with an eventual composition to create new ones semantically richer and more suitable to a co-operative environment/context. In order to propose an operational method, the last stage will propose to obtain rules derived from a specification language associated to the method. These rules allow the realisation of the implementation of the concrete co-operation. Next, they will be executed into the distributed run- time we developed. They will allow the dynamic workgroup management and the circulating of co-operative elements. Our approach allows the provision of co-operation thanks to the application re-engineering without modifying any existing operative module. We propose a method entirely derivable (after a formal verification) into rules integrated into a co-operative architecture allowing the co-operation.",

In offline analysis, we mine historical transfer logs to perform knowledge discovery about the transfer characteristics. Online phase uses the discovered knowledge from the offline analysis along with real-time investigation of the network condition to optimize the protocol parameters. As real-time investigation is expensive and provides partial knowledge about the current network status, our model uses historical knowledge about the network and data to reduce the real-time investigation overhead while ensuring near optimal throughput for each transfer.

We assume rateless coding scheme is adopted at the transmitter and an update can be successfully decoded if k coded symbols are received successfully. We assume perfect feedback available at the source, so that it knows whether a transmitted symbol has been erased instantly. Then, at the beginning of each time slot, the source has the choice to start transmitting a new update, or continue with the transmission of the previous update if it is not delivered yet. We adopt the metric \"Age of Information\" (AoI) to measure the freshness of information at the destination, where the AoI is defined as the age of the latest decoded update at the destination. Our objective is to design an optimal online transmission scheme to minimize the time-average AoI. The transmission decision is based on the instantaneous AoI, the age of the update being transmitted, as well as the number of successfully delivered symbols of the update. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and identify the monotonic threshold structure of the optimal policy.

We find many changes to the structure of the contracts that cannot be fully explained by changes in the assets at risk in the relationship, and evidence that these changes are largely the result of processes in which the firms were learning how to work together, including learning how to contract with each other. The nature of this learning appears to have been quite incremental and local, that is, not very far sighted. We suggest how and when contracts might serve as repositories for knowledge about how to govern collaborations, and suggest some boundary conditions for this phenomenon.

The SIP proxy server derives bandwidth requirements of SIP calls directly from parsed SIP messages. The bandwidth of the logical trunks can be dynamically changed. With a moderate trunk over-sizing, the trunk resizing rate can be kept much lower than the call arrival process. The approach scales well in a scenario where a centralized entity (bandwidth broker) is in charge of managing all the trunks of a given domain.

The technique, however, involves two major problems: one is that decision with a single global threshold often produces poor segmentation results and the other is that an estimation for the optimal threshold is actually difficult. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a very simple yet effective algorithm that refers to the status of previously judged neighboring pixels: more specifically, the proposed algorithm varies the threshold value in accordance with the status of the reference pixels. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed technique gives better segmentation results than the simple background differencing one with the optimal global threshold.",

In this framework there is no direct way to represent action priorities, where an action can execute only if all other enabled actions have lower priority. We here demonstrate that the psi-calculi parameters can be chosen such that the effect of action priorities can be encoded.To accomplish this we define an extension of psi-calculi with action priorities, and show that for every calculus in the extended framework there is a corresponding ordinary psi-calculus, without priorities, and a translation between them that satisfies strong operational correspondence. This is a significantly stronger result than for most encodings between process calculi in the literature.We also formally prove in Nominal Isabelle that the standard congruence and structural laws about strong bisimulation hold in psi-calculi extended with priorities.",

    "abstract": "A main open question related to character-based tree reconstruction is designing generalizations of the Perfect Phylogeny approach that couple efficient algorithmic solutions to the capability of explaining the input binary data, by allowing back mutations of some characters. Following this goal, the Persistent Phylogeny model and the related tree reconstruction problem (the PPP problem) have been recently introduced: this model allows only one back mutation for each character. The investigation of the combinatorial properties and the complexity of the model is still open: the most important such question is whether the PPP problem is NP-hard. Here we propose a graph-based approach to the PPP problem by showing that instances can be represented by colored graphs, while the solutions are obtained by operations on such graphs. Indeed, we give a graph-based characterization of the solutions to the PPP problem by showing the relationship between certain sequences of graph operations on the instance graphs and traversals of a persistent phylogeny solving these instances. Based on this result and on some combinatorial properties of the instance graphs we are able to give a polynomial time algorithm for a restricted version of the PPP problem.",

Based on the IS-95 scheme, we consider Reed-Solomon (RS)-coded M-ary orthogonal modulation with error or erasures decoding, which presents good performance enhancement with low complexity. LEO satellite links are characterized by large Doppler frequency shifts caused by the difference in velocity between the satellite and the earth mobile terminal, which make conventional non-coherent detection ineffective. In order to overcome the phase shift variations during the symbol period, which result in orthogonality loss of the WH sequences, we applied a differential encoding process to the spreading sequences or the WH chips prior to transmission. A special diversity process suitable for the environment under consideration is also applied.

The combinations of these elements result in diverse argument patterns. Failed opening consists of an initial claim only, whereas nonoppositional argument pattern also includes indications of support. Oppositional argument pattern contains the elements of counterclaim and rebuttal. Mixed argument pattern entails all 5 elements. The empirical data were gathered by downloading from Yahoo!

Of the argument patterns, failed openings were most frequent, followed by oppositional, nonoppositional, and mixed patterns. In most cases, the participants grounded their arguments by drawing on personal beliefs and facts.

The pictorial view of the architecture of modules abstracts to a directed, connected, acyclic graph whose nodes are modules and whose arcs reveal the reference dependency relationship. No distinction exists among the modules. This paper provides a decided distinction. This paper introduces a new, formal, objective classification scheme of ten classes for modules. The process of fashioning the classification scheme applies the software principle of information hiding to three internal structural components of a module. These components are the variable, the data structure, and the subprogram. Two conceptual constructs enable information hiding. One is the encapsulation of a data structure (object). The other is the inaccessible section of a module which is the section that no external module can reference. Each module belongs to exactly one class. The assignment of a module to a class is objective, not subjective. The scheme opens up the opportunity for a deeper study into each class. The classes of the scheme are subjectively ranked into four categories, ranging from best to worst. The paper lists five benefits of this classification scheme, and relates these benefits to three application areas.",

As suggested by our theoretical analysis of the algorithms for a variety of special cases, an extensive set of numerical experiments clearly indicate that all of the BDF-based ADI algorithms proposed in this paper are \\\"quasi-unconditionally stable\\\" in the following sense: each algorithm is stable for all couples ( h , Δ t ) of spatial and temporal mesh sizes in a problem-dependent rectangular neighborhood of the form ( 0 , M h ) × ( 0 , M t ) . In other words, for each fixed value of Δt below a certain threshold, the Navier-Stokes solvers presented in this paper are stable for arbitrarily small spatial mesh-sizes. The second-order formulation has further been rigorously shown to be unconditionally stable for linear hyperbolic and parabolic equations in two-dimensional space. Although implicit ADI solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations with nominal second-order of temporal accuracy have been proposed in the past, the algorithms presented in this paper are the first ADI-based Navier-Stokes solvers for which second-order or better accuracy has been verified in practice under non-trivial (non-periodic) boundary conditions.",

In other words, the evaluation of a specific solution for a given scenario could be perceived as the evaluation of this solution according to one particular criterion.

A selection combining scheme is used to obtain an easily implementable receiver structure at the destination. An analytical expression for the end-to-end symbol error probability (SEP) of the system for M-ary phase-shift keying is derived using a new approach, which we call a paired error approach. As a special case, we obtain, in closed form, the end-to-end SEP for binary phase-shift keying. We also present a modified selection combining scheme to incorporate the effect of the interuser link, that is, the source to relay link, in the evaluation of the error performance. Results show that cooperative diversity becomes effective for a larger range of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the user to destination link as the average SNR of the interuser link increases.

These information could be used to identify the most important actors for each movie. While users are drawn to an item due to a subset of its features, a user-item interaction only provides an expression of user preference over the entire item, and not its component features. We design algorithms to rank the features of an item depending on whether interaction information is available at aggregated or individual level granularity and extend them to rank composite features (set of features).

This extension aims to construct a model that can be used within the CA framework to study the relation between information processing and pattern formation in collective systems. Even though the extension presented here is merely an extrapolation to a CA having a larger rule neighborhood identical to the perception area, the extra radius can be interpreted as an individual attribute of each cell. The novel perspective to CA provided here makes it possible to build heterogeneous CAs, which contain cells having different extra radii. Several pattern formations in the extension of one-dimensional elementary CAs and two-dimensional Life-like CAs are presented.

To evaluate the correctness of timestamps, temporal constraints could be employed, which declare the distance restrictions between timestamps. Guided by such constraints on timestamps, in this paper, we study a novel problem of repairing inconsistent timestamps that do not conform to the required temporal constraints. Following the same line of data repairing, the timestamp repairing problem is to minimally modify the timestamps towards satisfaction of temporal constraints. This problem is practically challenging, given the huge space of possible timestamps. We tackle the problem by identifying a concise set of promising candidates, where an optimal repair solution can always be found. Repair algorithms with efficient pruning are then devised over the identified candidates.

In the United States (U.S.), different kinds of rules—federal statutes and regulations, scientific norms, and professional ideals—guide the work of researchers. Penalties for violating these different kinds of rules and norms can range from the displeasure of peers to criminal sanctions. We proposed that it would be more difficult for researchers working in the U.S. who were born in other nations to distinguish the seriousness of violating rules across diverse domains. We administered a new measure, the evaluating rules in science task (ERST), to National Institutes of Health-funded investigators (101 born in the U.S. and 102 born outside of the U.S.). The ERST assessed perceptions of the seriousness of violating research regulations, norms, and ideals, and allowed us to calculate the degree to which researchers distinguished between the seriousness of each rule category. The ERST also assessed researchers’ predictions of the seriousness that research integrity officers (RIOs) would assign to the rules. We compared researchers’ predictions to the seriousness ratings of 112 RIOs working at U.S. research-intensive universities. U.S.-born researchers were significantly better at distinguishing between the seriousness of violating federal research regulations and violating ideals of science, and they were more accurate in their predictions of the views of RIOs.

In this work, the authors derive exact probability density function (PDF) expressions for the BER and the channel capacity for an arbitrary irradiance model. In particular, they investigate these exact results for log-normal, gamma-gamma, and K distributions. For the BER analysis, they focus on the binary phase shift keying and quadrature phase shift keying modulation schemes. The authors' analytical reults are found to be in conformity with Monte Carlo simulations.

    "abstract": "Model based predictive control (MBPC) has been extensively investigated and is widely used in industry. Besides this, interest in non-linear systems has motivated the development of MBPC formulations for non-linear systems. Moreover, the importance of security and reliability in industrial processes is in the origin of the fault tolerant strategies developed in the last two decades. In this paper a MBPC based on support vector machines (SVM) able to cope with faults in the plant itself is presented. The fault tolerant capability is achieved by means of the accurate on-line support vector regression (AOSVR) which is capable of training an SVM in an incremental way. Thanks to AOSVR is possible to train a plant model when a fault is detected and to change the nominal model by the new one, that models the faulty plant. Results obtained under simulation are presented.",

    "abstract": "In todayýs deep-submicron designs, the interconnect delays contribute an increasing part to the overall performance of an implementation. Particularly when targeting field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), interconnect delays are crucial, since they can easily vary by orders of magnitude. Many existing performance-directed retiming methods use simple delay models which either neglect routing delays or use inaccurate delay estimations. In this paper, we propose a retiming approach which overcomes the problem of inaccurate delay models. Our retiming technique uses delay information extracted from a fully placed and routed design and takes account of register timing requirements. By applying physical constraints, we ensure that the delay information remains valid during retiming. In our experiments, we achieved up to 27% performance improvement.",

Due to scalability reasons, each participant in a gossip protocol maintains a partial view of the system.

Several algorithms have been proposed to maintain partial views for gossip protocols. In this paper, we show that under a high number of faults, these algorithms take a long time to restore the desirable view properties. To address this problem, we present HyParView, a new membership protocol to support gossip-based broadcast that ensures high levels of reliability even in the presence of high rates of node failure.

In this paper, novel synthesis conditions are derived to synthesise robust GS controllers with mixed H-2/H-infinity performance subject to uncertain scheduling parameters. The conditions are formulated in terms of parameterised bilinear matrix inequalities (PBMIs) that depend on varying parameters inside multi-simplex domain. The conditions provide practical GS controllers independent of the derivatives of scheduling parameters. That is, the designed controllers are feasible for implementation. Since bilinear matrix inequality problems are intractable, an iterative PBMI algorithm is developed to solve the developed synthesis conditions. By the virtue of this algorithm, conservativeness reduction is achieved with few iterations. Examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed conditions.

It has been noted that the adhesion of sputtered metal to the epoxies differs greatly depending on the metal used. The effects of heating after sputtering have also been identified.

Clustering Web services based on their functional features to different domains have started to play a major role in several service management tasks such as efficient Web service discovery and recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel ontology-based approach for Web service clustering. Instead of using traditional methods, we focus on the similarity and specificity of terms for ontology generation. The amount of domain-specific information included in a term is used to define the specificity of that term. Specific terms are more powerful than general terms for describing a large amount of domain information. Taking advantage of this, we generate a new ontology, which is then used to calculate similarity by defining new logic-based filters. When the similarity calculation fails, we apply information retrieval-based methods. Based on a comprehensive evaluation that we conducted to measure the performance of our method, our novel clustering approach was shown to be more effective in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, purity and entropy than other existing clustering approaches.",

IMDs, which include pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators, are therapeutic medical devices partially or wholly embedded in the human body. They often have built-in radio communication to facilitate non-invasive reprogramming and data readout. Many IMDs, though, lack well designed authentication protocols, exposing patients to over-the-air attack and physical harm. H2H makes use of ECG (heartbeat data) as an authentication mechanism, ensuring access only by a medical instrument in physical contact with an IMD-bearing patient. Based on statistical analysis of real-world data, we propose and analyze new techniques for extracting time-varying randomness from ECG signals for use in H2H. We introduce a novel cryptographic device pairing protocol that uses this randomness to protect against attacks by active adversaries, while meeting the practical challenges of lightweight implementation and noise tolerance in ECG readings. Finally, we describe an end-to-end implementation in an ARM-Cortex M-3 microcontroller that demonstrates the practicality of H2H in current IMD hardware. Previous schemes have had goals much like those of H2H, but with serious limitations making them unfit for deployment---such as naively designed cryptographic pairing protocols (some of them recently broken). In addition to its novel analysis and use of ECG entropy, H2H is the first physiologically-based IMD device pairing protocol with a rigorous adversarial model and protocol analysis.",

Although many feature extraction and retrieval algorithms have been proposed, they generally only use single 3D model descriptor hence cannot obtain better retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a new 3D shape retrieval framework based on compressive sensing (CS) and multi-feature fusion (MFF). Firstly, we extract three new features including the CS Chebyshev ray (CSCR) feature, the CS spatial hierarchical (CSSH) feature and the Extended Gaussian sphere (EGS) feature. Actually, CSCR, CSSH and EGS respectively represent the volume tensor, the layered detail and the statistical space distribution on the model surface of a 3D model. To make the best use of these features, a supervised learning is used to determine the weighting coefficients for these features. Finally, the features and their corresponding weighting coefficients are used to determine the similarity of 3D models in the multi-feature fusion (MFF) framework for 3D shape retrieval. For performance assessment, two publicly available datasets that contain 3D models with large geometric variations are used, including ModelNet-10 and PSB datasets. Comprehensive experimental results have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method for 3D shape retrieval.",

Ideally, we would take advantage of this under-utilization by allocating system resources so that the performance requirements are met and energy is minimized. This optimization problem is complicated by the fact that the performance and power consumption of various system configurations are often application -- or even input -- dependent. Thus, practically, minimizing energy for a performance constraint requires fast, accurate estimations of application-dependent performance and power tradeoffs. This paper investigates machine learning techniques that enable energy savings by learning Pareto-optimal power and performance tradeoffs. Specifically, we propose LEO, a probabilistic graphical model-based learning system that provides accurate online estimates of an application's power and performance as a function of system configuration. We compare LEO to (1) offline learning, (2) online learning, (3) a heuristic approach, and (4) the true optimal solution.

State-of-the-art RFID readers can use two methods for resolving this collision problem. The first method bases on Dynamic Frame Slotted ALOHA (DFSA) for optimizing the frame length, which results in a reduced number of collisions. The second and more efficient method resolves collisions on the physical layer, e.g. by means of multi-antenna algorithms. However, the well-known EPCglobal class 1 gen 2 standards only allows for a single tag acknowledgment, even if the physical layer is able to identify multiple collided tags. This results in an overall reduced performance. For overcoming this drawback, we propose a system that has the capability to acknowledge multiple tags within a single slot, resulting in a significantly increased performance. Our proposal offers the benefit that it is backwards compatible with existing EPCglobal Class 1 gen 2 tags and readers. Hence, our improved tags can be read by conventional readers without affecting the performance. Furthermore, existing tags can be read simultaneously with our improved tags by optimized readers. Using our approach, we are able to increase the maximum reading efficiency compared to state-of-the-art systems by a factor of approx. 3.

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in utilizing green energy for data centers, where green energy sources include solar and wind. This paper studies the crucial problem of maximizing the utilization of green energy through scheduling complex jobs in data centers in order to reduce the use of traditional brown energy. However, it is highly challenging for data centers to make use of green energy. First, the availability of typical green energy is variable to dynamic changes of natural environments, for example, weather. Second, although predictions can be made for the future availability of green energy, it is inevitable that such predictions have errors. Third, jobs are associated with strict deadlines, and it is required that jobs are completed before their deadlines. Finally, because the reliability in a data center relies upon temperature, the awareness of temperature should be taken into account while maximizing the green energy. In this paper, we consider online scheduling of jobs whose arrivals to the data center system dynamically. In addition, we explicitly take the power consumption of switches into account when scheduling jobs onto computing nodes. Two solar energy-aware algorithms called SEEDMin and SEEDMax have been proposed. Then, we extend SEED to RSEED with the awareness of reliability. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, comprehensive simulations have been conducted, and the proposed algorithms are compared with other state-of-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that both SEEDMin and SEEDMax can significantly increase the utilization of solar energy without violating job deadlines and overall energy budget. The amount of solar energy utilized by SEEDMin and SEEDMax is 33.4%and35.3% larger than that of two traditional scheduling algorithms, MinMin and MinMax, respectively. Also, it can be seen that RSEED greatly improves the reliability by decreasing the temperature. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

However the necessary input data for these approaches are often ill-known especially when the data are a priori estimated. The common MCDA approaches consider these data as singular/scalar values. This paper deals with the consideration of more realistic, values by studying the impact of imprecision on a classical “precise” ranking established with ACUTA, a method based on additive utilities. We propose a generic approach to establish the concordance of pairwise relations of preference despite interval-based imprecision by complementing ACUTA with a computation of Kendall's index of concordance and of a threshold for maintaining this concordance. The methodology is applied to an industrial case subjected to Sustainable Development problems.",

    "abstract": "The use of intravenous thrombolysis for stroke is limited by contraindications that may be difficult to identify promptly and accurately. Evidence supports the use of information technology-based clinical decision support (CDS) tools to achieve improvements in care delivery. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the efficacy of a CDS tool to screen health records for contraindications to intravenous stroke thrombolysis.A CDS tool was developed to rapidly screen health information in seven affiliated hospitals for contraindications to stroke thrombolysis. A fixed-sequence, 2-period crossover study was conducted to test the efficacy of the CDS tool. Four mock patient records derived from the stroke registry that contained a total of nine contraindication items in two or more of the hospitals were used for testing purposes. The test patients were preset and balanced between groups with and without the CDS tool appearing six times in each group before recruiting the participating physicians. Physicians who were responsible for thrombolytic therapy and willing to sign informed consent were recruited. The participating physicians were asked to check a list of contraindications for two of the patients by using a shared electronic medical record system among the seven hospitals with and without the CDS tool. The test time and missed contraindications were recorded and analyzed statistically.A total of 14 physicians who were responsible for stroke thrombolysis were approached, and 12 signed informed consent and took the test. By using the CDS tool, the test time was reduced significantly from 14.6 ± 7.4 to 7.3 ± 5.2 min (P = 0.010). In a total of 54 contraindications, the number of missed contraindications was reduced significantly from 23 (42.6 %) to seven (13.0 %) (P = 0.001). The difference of missed contraindication number between the two groups was statistically significant either per physician or per contraindication item.By screening health records for relevant contraindications, the use of a CDS tool may reduce the time needed to review medical records and reduce the number of missed contraindications for stroke thrombolysis.",

    "abstract": "Continuous-time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) (Nodelman, Shelton, & Koller 2002; 2003), are an elegant modeling language for structured stochastic processes that evolve over continuous time. The CTBN framework is based on homogeneous Markov processes, and defines two distributions with respect to each local variable in the system, given its parents: an exponential distribution over when the variable transitions, and a multinomial over what is the next value. In this paper, we present two extensions to the framework that make it more useful in modeling practical applications. The first extension models arbitrary transition time distributions using Erlang-Coxian approximations, while maintaining tractable learning. We show how the censored data problem arises in learning the distribution, and present a solution based on expectation-maximization initialized by the Kaplan-Meier estimate. The second extension is a general method for reasoning about negative evidence, by introducing updates that assert no observable events occur over an interval of time. Such updates were not defined in the original CTBN framework, and we show that their inclusion can significantly improve the accuracy of filtering and prediction. We illustrate and evaluate these extensions in two real-world domains, email use and GPS traces of a person traveling about a city.",

In order to realize not only scalable but also high performance information systems, serverclusterc systems are widely used.

The improved delay time-based (IDTB)algorithm is discussed to select a server for each request process in a homogeneous server cluster so that the total energy consumption of the homogeneous server cluster to perform application processes can be reduced. In a homogeneous cluster, every server follows the same computation model and power consumption model. In heterogeneous cluster, servers follow different types of computation models and power consumption models. In this paper, we propose an extended IDTB (EIDTB) algorithm to reduce the total energy consumption and response time of each process in heterogeneous server cluster.

Variational methods, which have been used extensively in Bayesian machine learning for several years, provide a lower bound on the marginal likelihood, which can be computed efficiently. We provide results for the variational updates in several models especially emphasizing their use in multivariate spatial analysis.

    "abstract": "In wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, energy is a scarce resource and a considerable amount of energy is dissipated due to interference. Therefore, interference is one of the major challenges in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. It alters or disrupts a message as it is being transmitted along a channel between source and destination. Since the messages are disrupted when the interference occurs, they have to be detected and the interfered messages have to be retransmitted. In this paper, we propose central and distributed heuristic algorithms for reducing average interference in a receiver-centric interference model. In the literature, the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm is generally used through the interference coverage graph directly or indirectly in order to generate minimum average interference topology. Our algorithm, dynamic average interference (DAI), however, generates lower average interference as well as more sparse topology than MST. We realized that if the transmission ranges of nodes are taken into consideration at each stage of the topology control algorithm, the interference of links are changed dynamically. This interference changing enables up to 22% more energy saving than the MST algorithm. Thus, DAI provides energy saving by reducing the interference as far as possible in generated topology.",

Uniform sensitivity to blood appearing anywhere within the abdominal cavity was produced using a post-reconstructive filter that corrected for changes in apparent resistivity of anomalies with their radial position, The image parameter used as an indication of fluid quantity, the resistivity index, varied approximately linearly with the quantity of fluid added. A test of the system's response to the introduction of conductive fluid out of the electrode plane (when a blood-equivalent fluid was added to the stomach) found that the sensitivity of the system was about half that observed in the electrode plane. Breathing artifacts were found to upset quantitative monitoring of intraperitoneal bleeding, but only on time scales short compared with the fluid administration rate.

In the previous distributed node searching method, a locator traces the target along its movement path from its most frequently visited location. For this purpose, nodes leave traces during their movements and also store their long-term movement patterns in their frequently visited locations i.e., preferred locations. However, such tracing leads to a long delay and high overhead on the locator by long-distance moving. Our trace data study confirms these problems and provides the foundation of our design of a new node searching method, called target-oriented method TSearch. By leveraging social network properties, TSearch aims to enable a locator to directly move toward the target. Nodes create encounter records ERs indicating the locations and times of their encounters and make the ERs easily accessible by locators through message exchanges or a hierarchical structure. In node searching, a locator follows the target’s latest ER, the latest ERs of its friends i.e., frequently meeting nodes, its preferred locations, and the target’s possible locations deduced from additional information for node searching. Extensive trace-driven and real-world experiments show that TSearch achieves significantly higher success rate and lower delay in node searching compared with previous methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the microarchitecture of the RS64 IV, a multithreaded PowerPC® processor, and its memory system. Because this processor is used only in IBM iSeries™ and pSeries™ commercial servers, it is optimized solely for commercial server workloads. Increasing miss rates because of trends in commercial server applications and increasing latency of cache misses because of rapidly increasing clock frequency are having a compounding effect on the portion of execution time that is wasted on cache misses. As a result, several optimizations are included in the processor design to address this problem. The most significant of these is the use of coarse-grained multithreading to enable the processor to perform useful instructions during cache misses. This provides a significant throughput increase while adding less than 5% to the chip area and having very little impact on cycle time. When compared with other performance-improvement techniques, multithreading yields an excellent ratio of performance gain to implementation cost. Second, the miss rate of the L2 cache is reduced by making it four-way associative. Third, the latency of cache-to-cache movement of data is minimized. Fourth, the size of the L1 caches is relatively large. In addition to addressing cache misses, pipeline \"holes\" caused by branches are minimized with large instruction buffers, large L1 I-cache fetch bandwidth, and optimized resolution of the branch direction. In part, the branches are resolved quickly because of the short but efficient pipeline. To minimize pipeline holes due to data dependencies, the L1 D-cache access is optimized to yield a one-cycle load-to-use penalty.",

Any (declarative) approach to access control and trust management has to address the following issues: Explicit denial, inheritance, and overriding, and History-sensitive access control.Our main contribution is a policy algebra, in the timed concurrent constraint programming paradigm, that uses a form of default constraint programming to address the first issue, and reactive computing to address the second issue.The policy algebra is declarative --- programs can be viewed as imposing temporal constraints on the evolution of the system --- and supports equational reasoning. The validity of equations is established by coinductive proofs based on an operational semantics.The design of the policy algebra supports reasoning about policies by a systematic combination of constraint reasoning and model checking techniques based on linear time temporal-logic. Our framework permits us to perform security analysis with dynamic state-dependent restrictions.",

Our goal is to provide these abilities in a generic way so that the robot need not have an accurate and complete geometric model of all the objects in its environment. Rather, we wish to provide abilities to recognize common objects such as desks and doors which can be used as landmarks. We use a functionality-based representation for objects. Objects consist of functional parts, which are characterized by their significant surfaces, and by the accompanying functional evidence for them. Our system works with planar surfaces only and assumes that the objects are in a ‘standard’ pose. The localization and orientation of an object are represented with the most significant surface in an ‘s-map’. Our system has been tested on a number of real scenes where it performs robustly and efficiently; some results are shown in the paper.",

    "abstract": "Spatial records of species are commonly misidentified, which can change the predicted distribution of a species obtained from a species distribution model (SDM). Experiments were undertaken to predict the distribution of real and simulated species using MaxEnt and presence-only data contaminated with varying rates of misidentification error. Additionally, the difference between the niche of the target and contaminating species was varied. The results show that species misidentification errors may act to contract or expand the predicted distribution of a species while shifting the predicted distribution towards that of the contaminating species. Furthermore the magnitude of the effects was positively related to the ecological distance between the species' niches and the size of the error rates. Critically, the magnitude of the effects was substantial even when using small error rates, smaller than common average rates reported in the literature, which may go unnoticed while using a standard evaluation method, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Finally, the effects outlined were shown to impact negatively on practical applications that use SDMs to identify priority areas, commonly selected for various purposes such as management. The results highlight that species misidentification should not be neglected in species distribution modeling.",

The major and minor agents are coupled via both (i) their individual nonlinear stochastic dynamics and (ii) their individual finite time horizon nonlinear cost functions. This problem is analyzed by the so-called epsilon-Nash mean field game theory. A distinct feature of the mixed agent mean field game problem is that even asymptotically (as the population size N approaches infinity) the noise process of the major agent causes random fluctuation of the mean field behavior of the minor agents. To deal with this, the overall asymptotic (N -> infinity) mean field game problem is decomposed into (i) two nonstandard stochastic optimal control problems with random coefficient processes which yield forward adapted stochastic best response control processes determined from the solution of (backward in time) stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (SHJB) equations and (ii) two stochastic coefficient McKean-Vlasov (SMV) equations which characterize the state of the major agent and the measure determining the mean field behavior of the minor agents. This yields a stochastic mean field game (SMFG) system which is in contrast to the deterministic mean field game systems of standard MFG problems with only minor agents. Existence and uniqueness of the solutions to SMFG systems (SHJB and SMV equations) is established by a fixed point argument in the Wasserstein space of random probability measures. In the case where minor agents are coupled to the major agent only through their cost functions, the epsilon(N)-Nash equilibrium property of the SMFG best responses is shown for a finite N population system where epsilon(N) = O(1/root N).",

Experimental data show that this approach efficiently controls a helicopter while navigating through an unknown and unstructured environment.

Building on our recent flow-based characterization of network coding, we formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem. The formulation exploits pairwise coding possibilities between any pair of sessions, where the objective function is the sum of the utilities based on the rates supported by each session. With some manipulation on the Lagrangian of the formulated problem, a distributed algorithm is developed with no interaction between intermediate nodes, and each source having the freedom to choose its own utility function. The only information required by the source is the weighted sum of the queue length updates of each link, which can be piggy-backed on the acknowledgment messages. In addition to the optimal rate control algorithm, we propose a decentralized pairwise random coding scheme (PRC) that is optimal when a sufficiently large finite field is used for network coding. The convergence of the rate control algorithm is proved analytically and verified by extensive simulations. Simulations also demonstrate the advantage of our algorithm over the state-of-the-art in terms of throughput and fairness.",

Such schemes have recently received increased interest in both the database and the cryptographic communities. In particular, modular order-preserving encryption (MOPE), due to Boldyreva et al., is a promising extension that increases the security of the basic OPE by introducing a secret modular offset to each data value prior to encrypting it. However, executing range queries via MOPE in a naive way allows the adversary to learn this offset, negating any potential security gains of this approach. In this paper, we systematically address this vulnerability and show that MOPE can be used to build a practical system for executing range queries on encrypted data while providing a significant security improvement over the basic OPE. We introduce two new query execution algorithms for MOPE: our first algorithm is efficient if the user's query distribution is well-spread, while the second scheme is efficient even for skewed query distributions. Interestingly, our second algorithm achieves this efficiency by leaking the least-important bits of the data, whereas OPE is known to leak the most-important bits of the data. We also show that our algorithms can be extended to the case where the query distribution is adaptively learned online. We present new, appropriate security models for MOPE and use them to rigorously analyze the security of our proposed schemes. Finally, we design a system prototype that integrates our schemes on top of an existing database system and apply query optimization methods to execute SQL queries with range predicates efficiently. We provide a performance evaluation of our prototype under a number of different database and query distributions, using both synthetic and real datasets",

While this bound is extremely useful in practice, often real world signals are not only sparse, but also exhibit structure in the sparsity pattern. We focus on group-structured patterns in this paper. Under this model, groups of signal coefficients are active (or inactive) together. The groups are predefined, but the particular set of groups that are active (i.e., in the signal support) must be learned from measurements. We show that exploiting knowledge of groups can further reduce the number of measurements required for exact signal recovery, and derive universal bounds for the number of measurements needed. The bound is universal in the sense that it only depends on the number of groups under consideration, and not the particulars of the groups (e.g., compositions, sizes, extents, overlaps, etc.).

    "abstract": "One of the most powerful techniques for solving centralized constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) consists of maintaining local consistency during backtrack search (e.g. [11]). Yet, no work has been reported on such a combination in asynchronous settings. The difficulty in this case is that, in the usual algorithms, the instantiation and consistency enforcement steps must alternate sequentially. When brought to a distributed setting, a similar approach forces the search algorithm to be synchronous in order to benefit from consistency maintenance. Asynchronism [24,14] is highly desirable since it increases flexibility and parallelism, and makes the solving process robust against timing variations. One of the most well-known asynchronous search algorithms is Asynchronous Backtracking (ABT). This paper shows how an algorithm for maintaining consistency during distributed asynchronous search can be designed upon ABT. The proposed algorithm is complete and has polynomial-space complexity. Since the consistency propagation is optional, this algorithms generalizes forward checking as well as chronological backtracking. An additional advance over existing centralized algorithms is that it can exploit available backtracking-nogoods for increasing the strength of the maintained consistency. The experimental evaluation shows that it can bring substantial gains in computational power compared with existing asynchronous algorithms.",

A natural framework for addressing questions of functional connectivity is to apply Gaussian graphical modeling to neural data, where each edge in the graph corresponds to a non-zero partial correlation between neurons. Because the number of possible edges is large, one strategy for estimating the graph has been to apply methods that aim to identify large sparse effects using an [Formula: see text] penalty. However, the partial correlations found in neural spike count data are neither large nor sparse, so techniques that perform well in sparse settings will typically perform poorly in the context of neural spike count data. Fortunately, the correlated firing for any pair of cortical neurons depends strongly on both their distance apart and the features for which they are tuned. We introduce a method that takes advantage of these known, strong effects by allowing the penalty to depend on them: thus, for example, the connection between pairs of neurons that are close together will be penalized less than pairs that are far apart. We show through simulations that this physiologically-motivated procedure performs substantially better than off-the-shelf generic tools, and we illustrate by applying the methodology to populations of neurons recorded with multielectrode arrays implanted in macaque visual cortex areas V1 and V4.",

    "abstract": "Opponent-model (OM) search comes with two types of risk. The first type is caused by a player’s imperfect knowledge of the opponent, the second type arises from low-quality evaluation functions. In this paper, we investigate the desirability of a precondition, called admissibility, that may prevent the second type of risk. We examine the results of two sets of experiments: the first set is taken from the game of LOA, and the second set from the KQKR chess endgame. The LOA experiments show that when admissibility happens to be absent, the OM results are not positive. The chess experiments demonstrate that when an admissible pair of evaluation functions is available, OM search performs better than minimax, provided that there is sufficient room to make errors. Furthermore, we conclude that the expectation ‘the better the quality of the prediction of the opponent’s move, the more successful OM search is’ is only true if the quality of both evaluation functions is sufficiently high.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing and virtualization techniques provide mobile devices with battery energy saving opportunities by allowing them to offload computation and execute code remotely. When the cloud infrastructure consists of heterogeneous servers, the mapping between mobile devices and servers plays an important role in determining the energy dissipation on both sides. From an environmental impact perspective, any energy dissipation related to computation should be counted. To achieve energy sustainability, it is important reducing the overall energy consumption of the mobile systems and the cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, reducing cloud energy consumption can potentially reduce the cost of mobile cloud users because the pricing model of cloud services is pay-by-usage. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic approach to optimize the overall energy in a mobile cloud computing system. We formulate the energy minimization problem as a congestion game, where each mobile device is a player and his strategy is to select one of the servers to offload the computation while minimizing the overall energy consumption. We prove that the Nash equilibrium always exists in this game and propose an efficient algorithm that could achieve the Nash equilibrium in polynomial time. Experimental results show that our approach is able to reduce the total energy of mobile devices and servers compared to a random approach and an approach which only tries to reduce mobile devices alone.",

Such a community evaluation has not been previously executed. Task 1a included a total of 22 system submissions, and Task 1b included 17. Most of the systems employed a combination of rules and machine learners. Materials and methods We used a subset of the Shared Annotated Resources (ShARe) corpus of annotated clinical text-199 clinical notes for training and 99 for testing (roughly 180 K words in total). We provided the community with the annotated gold standard training documents to build systems to identify and normalize disorder mentions. The systems were tested on a held-out gold standard test set to measure their performance. Results For Task 1a, the best-performing system achieved an F-1 score of 0.75 (0.80 precision; 0.71 recall). For Task 1b, another system performed best with an accuracy of 0.59. Discussion Most of the participating systems used a hybrid approach by supplementing machine-learning algorithms with features generated by rules and gazetteers created from the training data and from external resources. Conclusions The task of disorder normalization is more challenging than that of identification. The ShARe corpus is available to the community as a reference standard for future studies.",

    "abstract": "A practical constraint that comes in the way of spectrum estimation of a continuous time stationary stochastic process is the minimum separation between successively observed samples of the process. When the underlying process is not band-limited, sampling at any uniform rate leads to aliasing, while certain stochastic sampling schemes, including Poisson process sampling, are rendered infeasible by the constraint of minimum separation. It is shown in this paper that, subject to this constraint, no point process sampling scheme is alias-free for the class of all spectra. It turns out that point process sampling under this constraint can be alias-free for band-limited spectra. However, the usual construction of a consistent spectrum estimator does not work in such a case. Simulations indicate that a commonly used estimator, which is consistent in the absence of this constraint, performs poorly when the constraint is present. These results should help practitioners in rationalizing their expectations from point process sampling as far as spectrum estimation is concerned, and motivate researchers to look for appropriate estimators of bandlimited spectra.",

The approach exploits the problem solving skills of each user and learns different solutions for deviations that could occur in an assembly process. The experimental evaluations show the ability of the robotic system to handle deviations in an assembly process, while taking different user preferences into consideration.

    "abstract": "This paper mainly focuses on the problem of camera calibration and 3D reconstruction from a single view of structured scene. It is well known that three constraints on the intrinsic parameters of a camera can be obtained from the vanishing points of three mutually orthogonal directions. However, there usually exist one or several pairs of line segments, which are mutually orthogonal and lie in the pencil of planes defined by two of the vanishing directions in the structured scenes. It is proved in this paper that a new independent constraint to the image of the absolute conic can be obtained if the pair of line segments is of equal length or with known length ratio in space. The constraint is further studied both in terms of the vanishing points and the images of circular points. Hence, four independent constraints on a camera are obtained from one image, and the camera can be calibrated under the widely accepted assumption of zero-skew. This paper also presents a simple method for the recovery of camera extrinsic parameters and projection matrix with respect to a given world coordinate system. Furthermore, several methods are presented to estimate the positions and poses of space planar surfaces from the recovered projection matrix and scene constraints. Thus, a scene structure can be reconstructed by combining the planar patches. Extensive experiments on simulated data and real images, as well as a comparative test with other methods in the literature, validate our proposed methods.",

Fuzzy rule-based fault diagnosis schemes for satellite formation flight are developed and investigated at different levels in the hierarchy for a leader-follower architecture. Our formation level fault diagnosis is found to be useful as a supervisory diagnosis scheme that can prompt the operators to have a closer look at the potential faulty components to determine the sources of a fault.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid content centric architecture based on our pub/sub enhancement to CCN, Content-Oriented Publish/Subscribe System (COPSS). Our hybrid architecture (hybrid-COPSS) addresses both the need for incremental deployment of CCN and also elegantly combines the functionality of content centric networks and the efficiency of IP forwarding. Our architecture integrates IP multicast to achieve forwarding efficiency by taking advantage of shortest path routing. To overcome the lack of inter-domain IP multicast, hybrid-COPSS uses COPSS multicast with shortcuts as an overlay and IP multicast as the underlay to achieve inter-domain COPSS multicast. To demonstrate the benefits of our hybrid-COPSS architecture, we study its applicability for online gaming, which typically requires low latency. We use a gaming trace in our lab test-bed and microbenchmark the forwarding performance and queuing for a pure COPSS (representative of a pure CCN) based network versus hybrid-COPSS. Also, a large scale simulation (parameterized by the microbenchmark) on a representative ISP topology was used to evaluate the response latency and aggregate network load for the multi-player online gaming scenario. Our preliminary results show that hybrid-COPSS performs better in terms of response latency compare to pure COPSS in a single domain. In a multi-domain environment, hybrid-COPSS can significantly reduce inter-domain traffic while causing only a small increase in the average response latency.",

A concise model of traffic is proposed to describe a signalized road network considering conservation of traffic. In the model, the traffic of two sections that belong to a traffic signal group of a junction are represented by a single continuous variable. Therefore, the number of variables required to describe traffic in the network becomes half compared with the models that describe section wise traffic flows. The traffic signal at the junction is represented by a binary variable to express a signal state either green or red. The proposed model is transformed into a mixed logical dynamical system to describe the traffic flows in a finite horizon, and traffic signals are optimized using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) for a given performance index. The scheme simultaneously optimizes all traffic signals in a network in the context of model predictive control by successively extending or terminating a green or red signal of each junction. Consequently, traffic signal patterns with the optimal free parameters, i.e., the cycle times, the split times and the offsets, are realized. Use of the proposed concise traffic model significantly reduces the computation time of the scheme without compromising the performance as it is evaluated on a small road network and compared with a previously proposed scheme.",

However, the electrical properties and crossbar structure of memristors make these accelerators error-prone. To enable reliable memristor-based accelerators, a simulation platform is needed to precisely analyze the impact of non-ideal circuit and device properties on the inference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a flexible simulation framework, DL-RSIM, to tackle this challenge. DL-RSIM simulates the error rates of every sum-of-products computation in the memristor-based accelerator and injects the errors in the targeted TensorFlow-based neural network model. A rich set of reliability impact factors are explored by DL-RSIM, and it can be incorporated with any deep learning neural network implemented by TensorFlow. Using three representative convolutional neural networks as case studies, we show that DL-RSIM can guide chip designers to choose a reliability-friendly design option and develop reliability optimization techniques.",

The service applying P2P technique in MANET is increased because this structure is very similar to the structure of MANET. However, the reliability may be lower by providing an erroneous service from malicious nodes because the supervision of management for nodes participating in P2P does not perform. In this paper, we propose hybrid trust evaluation technique based on Trust Zone structure to improve the reliability between nodes. TZM node is elected for trust evaluation of member nodes internal each TrustZone. The certificate of member nodes is issued in the elected TZM and the information is stored in TZMT. The data transmission of malicious nodes is blocked by limiting the data transmission of nodes that do not issued the certificate.

An even more important requirement, however, is that they will support by architectural means the generation, execution, and maintenance of “quality software,” as a way out of the “software crisis.” One approach towards the design and implementation of quality software is programming with abstract data types, in connection with elaborate type consistency checking. The objection raised against the abstract data type based programming style is poor run time efficiency when such programs are executed on a conventional machine. In this paper adata type architecture is described that offers efficient and convenient mechanism for constructing arbitrary data structures and encapsulating them into abstract data types, thus avoiding the inefficiency penalty mentioned above. Through a process of hierarchical decomposition, user-defined abstract data types are mapped on representations given in terms of a basicstructured machine data type. This approach combines high performance with generality and completeness. The hardware structure of the data type architecture can be classified as a strongly coupled, asymmetric multicomputer system with hierarchical function distribution among the computers. The system includes a pipeline for numerical and nonnumerical operations, performed on the vector-structured basic machine data type in the SIMD mode of operation. Software reliability and data security is enhanced through elaborate run time consistency checking.

In this paper, we use the ideas of naturally occurring ants' foraging behavior (Dorigo and Stuetzle, 2004) [1] and based on those ideas, we design an energy-aware routing protocol, which not only incorporates the effect of power consumption in routing a packet, but also exploits the multi-path transmission properties of ant swarms and, hence, increases the battery life of a node. The efficiency of the protocol with respect to some of the existing ones has been established through simulations. It has been observed that the energy consumed in the network, the energy per packet in the case of EAAR are 60% less compared to MMBCR and the packets lost is only around 12% of what we have in AODV, in mobility scenarios.",

In a mesh-based multiprocessor, after repeated submesh allocations and de-allocations, the system network may be fragmented, i.e. there might be unallocated nodes in the network. As a result, in a system with contiguous processor allocation, no new tasks can start running due to the lack of enough free adjacent processors to form a suitable submesh. Although there might be enough free processors available, they remain idle until the allocator can find a set of adjacent free nodes forming a submesh to be used for the new task. This can lead to low system performance. Task migration was introduced as a solution to this problem through migration of tasks running on some submeshes to other free areas in order to reduce fragmentation by chaining the newly freed areas and disengaging nodes to form larger submeshes. In this paper, we propose a novel structured and formulated way to code task migration, which is helpful for congestion detection in different steps of task migration algorithms. Moreover, considering the fact that the 3D mesh-based multicomputers are now very popular, a new task migration algorithm in 3D meshes is proposed.

Learned models at each level of an ontology address the problem of no control over concept abstractness. A metric learning module moves beyond the limitation of traditional use of features and incorporates heterogeneous semantic ev- idence into the learning process. The metric-based learn- ing framework integrates these separate components into a single, unifled solution.

    "abstract": "A novel local stereo matching algorithm is introduced to address the fundamental challenge of stereo algorithms, accuracy and computational complexity dilemma. The time consuming intensity dependent aggregation procedure of local methods is improved in terms of both speed and precision. Providing connected 2D support regions, the proposed approach exploits a new paradigm, namely separable successive weighted summation (SWS) among horizontal and vertical directions enabling constant operational complexity. The weights are determined by four-neighborhood intensity similarity of pixels and utilized to model the information transfer rate, permeability, towards the corresponding direction. The same procedure is also utilized to diffuse information through overlapped pixels during occlusion handling after detecting unreliable disparity assignments. Successive weighted summation adaptively cumulates the support data based on local characteristics, enabling disparity maps to preserve object boundaries and depth discontinuities. According to the experimental results on Middlebury stereo benchmark, the proposed method is one of the most effective local stereo algorithm providing high quality disparity models by unifying constant time filtering and weighted aggregation. Hence, the proposed algorithm provides a competitive alternative for various local methods in terms of achieving precise and consistent disparity maps from stereo video within fast execution time.",

In the GT5D, its sparse matrix-vector multiplication operation (SpMV) is performed as a 17-point stencil-based computation. The specialized part for the GT5D is only in the SpMV, and the other parts are usable also for other application program codes. In addition to the CA-GMRES, we implement and evaluate a modified variant of CA-GMRES (M-CA-GMRES) proposed in the previous study Idomura et al. (in: Proceedings of the 8th workshop on latest advances in scalable algorithms for large-scale systems (ScalA ’17), 2017. https://doi.org/10.1145/3148226.3148234) to reduce the amount of floating-point calculations. This study demonstrates that beneficial features of the CA-GMRES are in its minimum number of collective communications and its highly efficient calculations based on dense matrix–matrix operations. The performance evaluation is conducted on the Reedbush-L GPU cluster, which contains four NVIDIA Tesla P100 (Pascal GP100) GPUs per compute node. The evaluation results show that the M-CA-GMRES or CA-GMRES for the GT5D is advantageous over the GMRES or the generalized conjugate residual method (GCR) on GPU clusters, especially when the problem size (vector length) is large so that the cost of the SpMV is less dominant. The M-CA-GMRES is 1.09 ×, 1.22 × and 1.50 × faster than the CA-GMRES, GCR and GMRES, respectively, when 64 GPUs are used.",

For the purposes of modeling asperity friction, experiments have shown, and been supported through detailed finite element analyses, that frictional forces developed through tangential sliding scale linearly through a material parameter known as the junction strength. A junction strength model coupled with a discrete quasi-static contact mechanics analysis, using contacting surface descriptions sampled by AFM from actual polysilicon surfaces, predicts inelastic tangential displacements that are qualitatively consistent with observed PSTD response.

First, we prepare a set of intermediate sequences, whose longitudinal (voxel-to-voxel) correspondences are established in advance. For each time point of the subject, we then utilize sparsity learning to identify its correspondences in the intermediate images at the same age and thus of similar appearances. Next, the intermediate sequences are used to bridge the temporal \"gaps\" between different subject time points, while the sparsity-learning-based correspondence detection is jointly conducted for all subject images to impose the temporal consistency. Finally, the deformation field of each subject time point is reconstructed from the spatio-temporal correspondences. Experimental results show that our method is able to achieve the longitudinal registration of the infant subject despite its varying appearances along time.",

    "abstract": "Large multi-resolution terrain data sets are usually stored out-of-core. To visualize terrain data at interactive frame rates, the data needs to be organized on disk, loaded into main memory part by part, then rendered efficiently. Many main-memory algorithms have been proposed for efficient vertex selection and mesh construction. Organization of terrain data on disk is quite difficult because the error, the triangulation dependency and the spatial location of each vertex all need to be considered. Previous terrain clustering algorithms did not consider the per-vertex approximation error of individual terrain data sets. Therefore, the vertex sequences on disk are exactly the same for any terrain. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering algorithm which introduces the level-of-detail (LOD) information to terrain data organization to map multi-resolution terrain data to external memory. In our approach the LOD parameters of the terrain elevation points are reflected during clustering. The experiments show that dynamic loading and paging of terrain data at varying LOD is very efficient and minimizes page faults. Additionally, the preprocessing of this algorithm is very fast and works from out-of-core.",

Many of these use single-object approaches to typing, derived from solutions found in object-oriented systems, while others use metamodels as model types, but without a clear notion of polymorphism. Both of these approaches lead to brittle and overly restrictive reuse characteristics.

The expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at the destination is derived, where the transmissions are affected by multipath fading, path loss and interference. The analysis involves finding the ratio distribution of two random variables, representing the desired signal and the intra-region interference, respectively. The expression for CDF helps in ascertaining the outage probability at the destination. Hence, given a desired outage probability, a limit on the number of simultaneously active D2D links in a circular region can be determined, thereby allowing interference avoidance. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical model. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test is applied to further characterize the matching between simulation and analytical model.

However, in some cases, learning algorithms perform well on several imbalanced domains. Thus, it does not seem fair to directly correlate class imbalance to the loss of performance of learning algorithms. In this work, we develop a systematic study aiming to question whether class imbalances are truly to blame for the loss of performance of learning systems or whether the class imbalances are not a problem by themselves. Our experiments suggest that the problem is not directly caused by class imbalances, but is also related to the degree of overlapping among the classes.",

    "abstract": "Wireless access points (APs) divide a plane into small areas where their coverage ranges overlap. A mobile device can be located within a particular small overlapped area based on the unique set of APs covering the device. We formally define an Optimal Loc-deployment problem for both coverage and area localization. Our objective is to deploy a minimum number of APs that provide full communication coverage while achieving the ability to locate a mobile device within a certain area no larger than a given accuracy parameter. We obtain a formula that precisely determines the optimal solution for more than half of the accuracy values. For the rest of the accuracy values, we propose an algorithm that will return an approximation whose difference to the optimal solution is less than ε for any ε >; 0. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical evaluation and real experiments to validate our proposed solutions.",

A significant developmental challenge in this sector is inadequacy and inaccessibility of information regarding weather forecast.

We describe our Android mobile application that sends a customized weather forecast that is configured according to the user preferences. Information is disseminated by the cloud server through encrypted SMS to the subscribing farmers containing weather information. This information is encoded through visuals and icons in a simple to understand user-interface that is accompanied by Urdu language text in a design tailored for low-literate farmers of Pakistan.

We consider connecting multiple clients through multiple relay servers and study the server selection problem from a dense pool of content delivery network edge locations and datacenters to reduce the end-to-end delays between clients. To achieve scalability in the presence of a large number of candidate servers, we formulate server selection as a geometric problem in a delay space instead of in a graph, which turns out to be an extension of the well-known Euclidean k-median problem. We propose practical approximation schemes when using only one or two servers with theoretical worst-case guarantees as well as fast heuristics when using k servers.

Binding affinities are characterized by a stochastic shape space model. System loss arising from an individual infection is associated with disease severity, as measured by the total antigen population over the course of an infection. We monitor evolution of cell populations on the shape space over a string of infections, and find that the distribution of losses becomes increasingly heavy-tailed with time. Initially this lowers the average loss: the memory cell population becomes tuned to the history of past exposures, reducing the loss of the system when subjected to a second, similar infection. This is accompanied by a corresponding increase in vulnerability to novel infections, which ultimately causes the expected loss to increase due to overspecialization, leading to increasing fragility with age (i.e., immunosenescence). In our model, immunosenescence is not the result of a performance degradation of some specific lymphocyte, but rather a natural consequence of the built-in mechanisms for system adaptation. This \"robust, yet fragile\" behavior is a key signature of Highly Optimized Tolerance.",

Secondly, the methods and techniques used in phishing such as phishing emails, phishing websites and addresses, distributed attacks and redirected attacks as well as the data that phishers seek to obtain, is examined. Furthermore, the way to reduce the risk of phishing and in turn increase the trust between users and websites is explored. Here the importance of Trust and the Uncertainty Reduction Theory plus the fine balance between trust and control is explored.

In our scheme, two processes were applied in parallel to reduce the false-positive detections after initial nodule candidates were selected. One process consisted of adaptive filtering for enhancement of nodules and suppression of normal lung structures, followed by extraction of conventional morphological features. The other process consisted of a novel approach for elimination of false positives called the edge-guided wavelet snake model. In the latter process, multiscale edges of the candidate nodules were extracted to yield parts of the nodule boundaries. A wavelet snake was then used for fitting of these multiscale edges for approximation of the true boundaries of nodules. A boundary feature called the weighted overlap between the snake and the multiscale edges was calculated and used for elimination of false positives. Finally, the weighted overlap and the morphological features were combined by use of an artificial neural network for efficient reduction of false positives. Our scheme was applied to a publicly available database of digital chest images for pulmonary nodules. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was employed for evaluation of the performance of each process in the scheme. The combined features yielded a large reduction of false positives, and thus achieved a high performance in discriminating between true and false positives. These results show that our new method, in particular the false-positive reduction method based on the wavelet snake, is effective in improving the performance of a computerized scheme for detection of pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs.",

This technology produces a spectrum for each sample depicting the chemical shifts at which an unknown number of latent metabolites resonate.

Results: We develop a novel modification of PCA that is appropriate for analysis of NMR data, entitled Sparse Non-Negative Generalized PCA. This method yields interpretable principal components and loading vectors that select important features and directly account for both the non-negativity of the underlying spectra and dependencies at adjacent chemical shifts. Through the reanalysis of experimental NMR data on five purified neural cell types, we demonstrate the utility of our methods for dimension reduction, pattern recognition, sample exploration and feature selection.

As technology scales, due to manufacturing defects and process variations a large number of cells in a cache is expected to be faulty. The number of faulty cells varies from die to die and in the field of the application depends on the operating conditions (e.g., supply voltage, frequency). Several techniques have been proposed to tolerate faults in caches. A drawback of the redundancy based techniques is that the amount of redundancy is decided at the design time targeting a maximum number of faults, so in cases of a small number of faults (e.g., in the nominal supply voltage in a system with DVS) only a part of the redundant resources is used. In this paper we propose a new reconfigurable-self adaptive fault tolerant cache scheme. The unique characteristic of our scheme is that it uses its resources for both the reduction of the misses caused by the faulty blocks as well as for the reduction of conflict misses, depending on the number of faults, their distribution in the cache, and the running application.

Within the setting of a relational database management system, the removal of the original duplicate tuples can breach referential integrity. In this paper, a strategy is proposed to maintain referential integrity in a semantically correct manner, thereby optimizing the quality of relationships in the database. An algorithm is proposed that is able to propagate a fusion operation through the entire database. The algorithm is based on a framework of first and second order fusion functions on the one hand, and conflict resolution strategies on the other hand. It is shown how classical strategies for maintaining referential integrity, such as DELETE cascading, are highly specialized cases of the proposed framework.

On the basis of infrared patch-tensor (IPT) model, a novel nonconvex low-rank constraint named partial sum of tensor nuclear norm (PSTNN) joint weighted l(1) norm was employed to efficiently suppress the background and preserve the target. Due to the deficiency of RIPT which would over-shrink the target with the possibility of disappearing, an improved local prior map simultaneously encoded with target-related and background-related information was introduced into the model. With the help of a reweighted scheme for enhancing the sparsity and high-efficiency version of tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD), the total algorithm complexity and computation time can be reduced dramatically. Then, the decomposition of the target and background is transformed into a tensor robust principle component analysis problem (TRPCA), which can be efficiently solved by alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). A series of experiments substantiate the superiority of the proposed method beyond state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Since there is a wide range of applications requiring image color difference (CD) assessment (e.g. color quantization, color mapping), a number of CD measures for images have been proposed. However, the performance evaluation of such measures often suffers from the following major flaws: (1) test images contain primarily spatial- (e.g. blur) rather than color-specific distortions (e.g. quantization noise), (2) there are too few test images (lack of variability in color content), and (3) test images are not publicly available (difficult to reproduce and compare). Accordingly, the performance of CD measures reported in the state-of-the-art is ambiguous and therefore inconclusive to be used for any specific color-related application.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of power allocation for distributed estimation via diffusion in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). We consider a WSN consisting of smart sensor nodes (SNs) and common sensor nodes (CNs), and each SN is capable of performing SWIPT via multi-antenna beamforming to its neighboring (i.e., near-tier) CNs. In each diffusion iteration, all nodes collect measurements and exchange intermediate estimates with their neighbors. We first analyze the effect of each SN's beamforming design and each near-tier CN's harvested power allocation on the steady-state network-wide mean square deviation (MSD) of the diffusion least-mean-squares (LMSs) strategy. Then, we formulate a problem to minimize an upper bound MSD by jointly optimizing the global power allocation weights for each SN to perform beamforming, and the local power allocation proportion for each CN to perform measurement collection. We further show that the formulated non-convex problem is decomposable and propose a gradient-based iterative algorithm to find the optimal solution. In addition, for practical implementation, we propose adaptive online approaches to estimate some parameters required for system optimization. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that with optimal power allocation, our proposed scheme improves the MSD performance significantly, compared to the conventional diffusion LMS strategy without wireless power transfer (WPT).",

    "abstract": "The purchasing function of large firms has slowly evolved from the operational task of ordering products and services towards a strategic part of business. However, the full implications of strategic purchasing for firm innovation have yet to be explored. The contribution of this study is two-fold. First, we develop a relational view of strategic purchasing embracing both the quality of the purchasing function and the properties of its internal and external relations. Second, based on exploratory empirical analysis, we propose four patterns of the link between strategic purchasing and innovation. We find that strategic purchasing is an enabling, but not necessary, condition for a contribution of purchasing to innovation, which in turn mostly relates to the relational resources of purchasing.",
